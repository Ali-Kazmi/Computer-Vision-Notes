# Week 10 Probability, Statistics, Regression, Classification



## logistic regression 

- an exponential parametric model   
- used to predict a random variable 
- uses gradient descent and maximum likelihood 
- we will need correlations (bc its not independent)
- there are some formulas (that were conditional probability statements). Z is our normalization constant to make sure the probs added together equal 1. 
- uses sigmoid function for the threshold 
- uses maximum likelihood in the model 
- we use gradient descent for a minimization problem! We try to minimize theta. (calc 3 coming in handy haha. Theres a long derivation but no way im typing that out)
- they talked about learning rates here (pretty simple concept)
- this is a probabiliastic model 

I got an 80% here :(  missed one question out of 5. (man it was an easy question tooâ€¦. oops)
