# Computer-Vision-Notes
Here I will be posting notes on a computer vision class I am taking

These notes will follow UPenn’s Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine learning (ROBO2x). 

WHY: I’m taking this to develop experience in Matlab and to learn some of the interesting theory behind ML. I want to get involved in research soon, and hopefully this is a step on getting the technical background to do so. (EDIT: got into the ADePT lab, now going to competitions as part of the GT Marine Robotics Perception team). 

Outline of the course: see 0-detailed-goals for a week by week outline (as well as more on my current background) 

These notes are not intended for anyone to use (besides me). I’m doing these to learn and review the material and have a record of my progress. Also, to be clear upfront, I will not be posting any of the course code here as the course instructors requested.
