# Computer-Vision-Notes
Here I will be posting notes on a computer vision class I am taking summer 2019. See readme for details 

Hi! Welcome to my notes on Computer Vision. 

These notes will follow UPenn’s Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine learning (ROBO2x). 
I’m taking this on edx Summer 2019 (and likely fall 2019, as it is a 3 month class that i’m starting in July), and I put down $300 upfront for access to the programming assignments and quizzes. I’m not sure if that’s worth it, but compared to the price of a real class that’s nothing and at the very least it will keep me motivated! 

This is a masters level class (even counts for credit if I go to UPenn on campus for my masters), so I expect it to be challenging. 

My current background: I’m entering Georgia Tech this fall as a sophomore by credit hours (but i’m a freshman). For relevant courses, I have taken databases (SQL), multivariable calculus, AP CSA (Java), and AP CSP (javascript and an overview of the fields of CS). I should probably be taking a course more at my level, but the class looked interesting and the “only” prerequisite i’m missing is linear algebra (I plan on supplementing this with self study as needed).
 
WHY: I’m taking this to develop experience in Matlab and to learn some of the interesting theory behind ML. I want to get involved in research soon, and hopefully this is a step on getting the technical background to do so. Also I don’t want to get wrecked too hard freshman year, so this will keep my brain active over the summer while im busy doing everything else (travelling to london, going out with friends to rollercoaster parks, tutoring, spending time with family, orientation and class registration, etc). Plus, this stuff just looks cool. 

These notes are not intended as teaching material at all. I’m doing these to learn and review the material so that I can pass the class (60% is passing, but i’m hoping to get around 70-80%. Normally I would aim higher but considering it’s a masters level class im just trying to do my best and learn). I’m hoping that these will be accurate and useful to someone, but that might just be wishful thinking haha. If anyone reads this and wants to improve it or finds an error, let me know! 3ali.kazmi@gmail.com 

Hopefully someone reads this stuff :)
