# Computer-Vision-Notes
Here I will be posting notes on a computer vision class I am taking summer 2019. 

These notes will follow UPenn’s Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine learning (ROBO2x). 
I’m taking this on edx Summer 2019 (and likely fall 2019, as it is a 3 month class that i’m starting in July). I put down $300 up front for access to the programming assignments and quizzes. I’m not sure if that’s worth it yet, but compared to the price of a real class that’s nothing and at the very least it will keep me motivated! 

This is a masters level class (even counts for credit if I go to UPenn on campus for my masters), so I expect it to be challenging. 

My current background: I’m entering Georgia Tech this fall as a sophomore by credit hours (but i’m a freshman). For relevant courses, I have taken databases (SQL), multivariable calculus, AP CSA (Java), and AP CSP (javascript and an overview of the fields of CS). I should probably be taking a course more at my level, but the class looked interesting and the “only” prerequisite i’m missing is linear algebra (I plan on supplementing this with self study as needed).
 
WHY: I’m taking this to develop experience in Matlab and to learn some of the interesting theory behind ML. I want to get involved in research soon, and hopefully this is a step on getting the technical background to do so. Also I don’t want to get wrecked too hard freshman year, so this will keep my brain active over the summer while im busy doing everything else (travelling to london, going out with friends to rollercoaster parks, tutoring, spending time with family, orientation and class registration, etc). Plus, this stuff just looks cool. 

Outline of the course: (designed by the robo2x team. Instructors: Drs. Jianbo Shi, Kostas Danillidis, and Dan Lee. Available for free on edx, with charge for access to assignments and a certificate! Totally recommended). I put this here as documentation of the topics I plan to study. Note I may take a little more or less time than recommended here, as some of it is WAY out of my league. My goal is learning :). I will mark sections here as done only after doing the labs, projects, videos, and notes.  

Week 1: camera geometry and color sensing  (done) 

W2: Fourier transforms, image convolution, edge detection

W3: edge detection part 2, image pyramids 

W4: Feature Detection: filters, Sift, HOG

W5: Geometrical Transformation: Affine, Protective, and Ransac 

W6: Optical Flow Estimation 

W7: Image Morphing

W8: Image Blending

W9: Image Carving

W10: Probability, Regression, Classification 

W11: SVM and Object Recognition 

W12: CNN's 

These notes are not intended as teaching material at all. I’m doing these to learn and review the material so that I can pass the class (60% is passing, but i’m hoping to get around 70-80%. Normally I would aim higher but considering it’s a masters level class im just trying to do my best and learn). I’m hoping that these will be accurate and useful to someone, but that might just be wishful thinking haha. If anyone reads this and wants to improve it or finds an error, let me know! Also, to be clear upfront, I will not be posting any of the course code here. 



Hopefully someone reads this stuff :)
