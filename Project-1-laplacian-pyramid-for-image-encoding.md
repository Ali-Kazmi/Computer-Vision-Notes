# Project-1:  Laplacian Pyramid For Image Encoding

This was a REALLY COOL project. It essentially used laplacian pyramids to compress and decompress images. It was moderately difficult and I had to spend some time debugging syntax, but overall less challenging than I expected. The commented code stubs helped a lot too. It ended up being a few hundred lines of code. Now i'm at 16% in the course though! (done with weeks 1-3). 



## Part 1

Here we took everything we did from lab 3.1 and added an encoding method.



## part 2 

Here we performed the quantization of the laplacian pyramid. We also used matlab functions to compute the entropy



## Part 3

We took lab 2.1, which encoded images as fourier transformed compressions, and compared it to laplacian encoding! This new method was way better!
