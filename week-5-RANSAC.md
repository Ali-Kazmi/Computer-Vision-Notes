## Week 5: Ransac



I watched this video then took notes, so these notes will be more of a review for me. 

This is basically a better way of generating a regression line! Least squares is too sensititve to outliers. 





Four steps: 

1) random sample 

2) build a model (a line basically)

3 and 4) thresholding and inlier counting (put some distance away from the line then see how many points of the scatterplot are within the threshold)



This was cool because it used a lot of statistics. Hypothesis testing! 

Number of iterations required to reach correct estimate: 

â€‹	log(1-p)/log(1-w^n)

p= probability 

w=number of inliers/number of sample points (prob of choosing inlier)



Got a 100% on this sections quiz! :)
