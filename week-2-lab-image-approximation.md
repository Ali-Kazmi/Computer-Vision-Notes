# lab 2.1 

Here I did a 5 part image encoding process in matlab using fourier aproximations in 2d. 



I want to post the code here but won't because the course requested it :( 

Here are the methods I implemented though: 

- fast fourier transfom visualization
- Compression
- Decompresion
- signal to noise ratio 
- compression ratio

It was cool seeing all the signal processing theory applied to image compression! But apparently we can do better, see week 3
