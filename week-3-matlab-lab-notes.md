# Week 3 labs notes





## Overview 

I will not be posting any code! Just giving an overview of what I did

So the labs were basically implementing a paper from 1983 ("The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code", the pdf is available free online from mit)



I had to implement the following functions: 

- expand and reduce 
- gaussian pyramid
- laplacian pyramid 
- combine pyramids
- collapse pyramids



This code (mine ended up being 198 lines) wasn't too bad to implement. I had the most trouble with expand and reduce, surprisingly, because I had to spend time fixing annoying MATLAB syntax and row stuff…

The process of the online course was a bit annoying. They broke it up into parts, with an in browser matlab ide, which was nice. The issue was that as soon  as I finished a step I had to go to the next section to continue, but it would ask me to paste my old code again -_-. I feel like edx could do a better job autoporting it. Oh well, i got em done pretty fast anyway 

## The Result

A function that seamlessly blends two images! I thought this was amazing ngl. We used the classic example of blending the orange and the apple just like the paper, and I saw it at work (as well as seeing the gory details behind the math and the matrices and image blending…). I think I like this course! If I get lucky I can do some computer vision research during undergrad with some professor (lowkey flex but over the past 20 years gatech is the second—oof cmu--for Computer Vision research according to cs rankings.com). The field is super exciting though, and I really hope to learn more.., but I want to do some cool applications or projects with it after this course, so we'll se where that goes. I just gotta finish this first



## Course Progress

5% overall completed so far. 60% needed for a certificate. It is currently July 21. I need to finish this by august 16 (when I go to campus). The midterm is 25% of the grade and the final is some huge percent, so i'm hopeing I can prepare enough to earn the certificate soon…. but this is a TOUGH class. :) 

Cya next time (if anyone ever reads this, which is HIGHLY unlikely)
