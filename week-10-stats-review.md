# Week 10 Probability, Statistics, Regression, Classification

## Note

For anyone paying attention, yes I came here directly after week 3 and before finishing the week two lab or big first project. I felt like getting a little math for awhile 

This is on the path to the machine learning segments of the course, and isn't directly related to weeks 3-7 (although directly related to weeks 11 and 12).



## random variables (10.1)

- I know this from AP Statistics, so i'n not gonna take notes here 

- he also went over discrete probabilities (all probs add up to 1, conditional probability, etc)

- Bernoulli distribution

- mean=expected value (ew simple stats again)

- variance (yes, more ap stats… look up the formula if you're reading this im too tired to type it out)

- Joint distributions (kinda like a matrix of probabilities) (in ap stats this was a two way table...)

- marginal distribution: we sum up the joint distributions for X and sum up the jd for Y. 

- conditional probabilities (yes, the same stuff from ap stats… lots of formulas so im not rewriting all that here...)

- bayes rule: also stats, but this matters so i'll type it (youre welcome)

  - p(x|y)=(p(y|x)*p(x))/p(y)

  I got a 100% on this quiz, which was pretty easy (3 questions)
