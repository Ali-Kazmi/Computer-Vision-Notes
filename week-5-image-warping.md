## Week 5 image warping

Ok, so update: I did only 75% of week 4 labs. I couldn't get the week 4 lab (maximum surpression, the final step of harris corner detection. I plan on messaging the TA's for help with this, but last time I set up a TA appointment they never showed up so I don't have high hopes for it. The last part would take a lot of time but would only add .75% to the final grade, so im gonna prioritize moving ahead to this week (as i'm on a time crunch to try to hit 50% in the next two weeks before college starts then move ahead casually during the semester). So on to the next section! This and week 6 look hard, but lets see :) 



- image transformations==image warping 

This is when stuff moves in the real world. 

- applications to image stitching and panoramas 
- highly relevant to AR 



Homogeneous coordinates: 

- we think of 2d points in an image as part of a 3d coordinate system. A pictures is a canvas in a 3d world. 
- It is related to where the camera is (and focal length etc.) (this is related to week 1)
- camera is at focal length away from canvas. 



Note: the below wasn't in the course, it was just a relevant video I saw on youtube from georgia tech's computational photography course

Affine transformations: (essentially a shift from a rectangular picture to a parallelogram picture)

- origin doesn't necessarily map to origin 
- lines map to lines! 
- parallel lines stay parallel 
- can be defined as a matrix 





I watched the rest of week 5's videos (on image homography and uniform scaling and euclidian transformations) and took the quiz. Got 5/6. There was a lot of matrix algebra, so taking notes would take a really long time- I just focused on understanding. Now at 18% in the course overall (with 13 days before leaving for collegeâ€¦ I think if I do good on week 5 and 6 and the midterm I can get to around 45%, then casually finish the rest during the semester). Things are looking good :) 



On to the labs!
